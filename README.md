# Stay Safe Stay Clean

A crowd sourced disease prevention app which uses data which users reported to generate heatmaps of areas which other users can view. Individuals can also view areas by disease and filter diseases if there are too many to display. Users will also be alerted to stay safe stay clean (hence the name of the app) when they enter an area which has a high density of flu reports. 

## Node Installation
brew install node
npm install -g nodemon(if you plan to make changes and want to see them in real time)
